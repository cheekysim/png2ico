# Ico Converter

A simple tool to convert multiple images to a single ico file.

# How to use:
Place the .exe in the folder where the images are,
Any .png file with a name in this list will be converted: "16", "24", "32", "48", "64", "96", "128", "256"
File extension does not matter, as long as it is an image.
You do not need every file size, it will automatically pick the ones you have.
